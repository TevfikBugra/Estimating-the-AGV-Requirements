# Estimating-the-AGV-Requirements
The estimation of the automated guided vehicle requirements for a hypothetical flexible manufacturing system

## Abstract
 It is inevitable to state that developing economic and time-wise efficient ways of
 material-handling functions have been an essential part of manufacturing and warehouse
 facilities. In the last few decades, thanks to technological improvements, automated guided
 vehicles came into sight and became one of the most intriguing topics in the manufacturing
 area. To give more details, AGV is a type of mobile robot that follows a predetermined path
 or set of instructions for transportation or handling tasks within a manufacturing, warehouse,
 or distribution facility. AGVs are equipped with sensors and navigation systems that allow
 them to navigate around their environment and avoid obstacles. AGVs are costly items for
 these stated reasons. Therefore, it is a vital decision for manufacturing and warehouse owners
 whether or not AGVs are needed in their facilities. Even when the decision of using AGVs is
 taken, another crucial aspect is the quantity of AGVs to be used. Therefore, this paper aims to
 justify the usage of AGVs in manufacturing and warehouse facilities by suggesting different
 methods to decide on the quantity to be used.
